# Plant Vision – PRD

## Overview
Plant Vision is an AI-powered web application that allows users to submit photos of plants. The system uses computer vision and a trained model to predict the health state of the plant and identify possible diseases. The goal is to help plant owners quickly diagnose issues and receive actionable care advice.

## Core Features
- **Photo Submission**
  - Users can upload or take a photo of a plant using their device.
  - Supports common image formats (JPG, PNG).
- **Health State Prediction**
  - The app uses a computer vision model to analyze the image and predict if the plant is healthy or unhealthy.
- **Disease Detection**
  - If unhealthy, the model attempts to identify the most likely disease or issue (e.g., fungal infection, nutrient deficiency).
- **Results Display**
  - Shows the predicted health state, possible disease, and a confidence score.
  - Provides care recommendations or next steps.
- **History (Optional)**
  - Users can view a history of their previous submissions and results.

## User Experience
- **Personas**
  - Home gardeners, plant enthusiasts, and small-scale farmers.
- **Key Flows**
  - User visits the site → uploads a plant photo → receives instant health/disease prediction and advice.
- **UI/UX**
  - Simple, mobile-friendly interface.
  - Clear instructions for taking/uploading good-quality photos.

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Python
- **AI Model:** TensorFlow or PyTorch (image classification, disease detection)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (for user data and history)
- **Image Storage:** AWS S3 or similar
- **APIs:** REST endpoints for image upload, prediction, and results retrieval
- **Infrastructure:** Deployable to AWS, Vercel, or similar

## Development Roadmap
- **MVP**
  - User authentication (optional for MVP)
  - Image upload and storage
  - Integrate pre-trained plant health/disease model
  - Display prediction results and care advice
- **Future Enhancements**
  - User accounts and history
  - Model retraining with user feedback
  - Support for more plant species and diseases
  - Multi-language support

## Logical Dependency Chain
- Set up backend and image upload first
- Integrate and test AI model
- Build frontend for photo submission and results
- Add optional features (history, authentication)

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Model Accuracy:** Use open-source datasets and pre-trained models; allow for future retraining.
- **Image Quality:** Provide user guidance for good photos.
- **Data Privacy:** Secure image storage and user data.
